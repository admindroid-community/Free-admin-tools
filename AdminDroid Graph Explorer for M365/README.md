### View Graph Data the Way You Want

The default Microsoft Graph Explorer displays results only in JSON, which can be difficult to read and analyze.

AdminDroid Graph Explorer provides multiple viewing options so you can choose how data is displayed:

- **Quick Table View** – Get structured insights instantly  
- **Raw JSON View** – Perform deep data inspection when needed  
- **Expandable Tree View** – Drill down into nested properties easily  

Switch views anytime based on your task.

### Analyze Large Datasets with Ease

When queries return large datasets, the native Graph Explorer paginates results and requires manual navigation using OData links. Losing a previous link can make it difficult to revisit earlier records.

AdminDroid Graph Explorer simplifies pagination with: **Next and Previous navigation buttons**

- Seamless browsing across all result pages
- Consistent structured table view throughout navigation

Move through large datasets like flipping pages in a book.
